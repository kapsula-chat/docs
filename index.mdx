description: "Back to the Future: Why We Built Email-style Messaging for the Crypto Era"
---


The internet started decentralized. Email, the web, IRC—all built on the principle that anyone could run a server, and the network would just work. Then Big Tech happened. Today, your "private" messages flow through corporate servers in distant data centers, subject to surveillance, censorship, and the whims of platform policies.

We're building something different. A messenger that returns to the internet's federated roots, but crypto-native from day one.

## **The Problem with Modern Messaging**

Current messaging apps fall into two categories:

**Centralized platforms** (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord) give you convenience at the cost of sovereignty. Your messages live on someone else's servers. Your account can be suspended. Your data can be subpoenaed, sold, or leaked.

**"Decentralized" solutions** often aren't truly decentralized—they just move the centralization to a blockchain or require running complex infrastructure that only technical users can manage.

Both approaches miss something fundamental: **your identity should be cryptographic, not corporate**.

## **A Different Approach**

What if your messaging identity was simply an Ed25519 public key? What if finding your message server was as simple as a DNS lookup? What if anyone could run a node with minimal setup?

This is the architecture we're building:

### **Cryptographic Identity**

Your address **is** your Ed25519 public key. No usernames, no phone numbers, no corporate identity verification. Just pure cryptography. Control the private key, control the identity. Lose the key, lose everything. It's that simple.

### **Algorithmic Server Discovery**

When someone wants to message you, they perform an algorithmic DNS lookup on your public key to find your server. Think of it like email's MX records, but computed rather than configured. You can override this to point to your own server, or let the algorithm distribute load across public nodes.

### **Ephemeral Storage**

Servers store messages only until delivery—never longer than 7 days. No permanent databases of your conversations. No data mining your chat history. Messages are delivered and deleted, like the post office was supposed to work.

### **User-Controlled Sync**

When you add a new device, your existing devices get a notification: "New device wants your message history. Share it?" You decide what to sync and when. No corporate cloud needed.

## **Beyond Chat: Unified Crypto Identity**

But here's where it gets interesting. That same mnemonic phrase that generates your chat identity can also:

- **Generate Solana wallet addresses** for seamless in-chat payments
- **Create multiple personas** by combining your seed with different PIN codes
- **Serve as your identity** across other crypto-native applications

One seed phrase. Multiple identities. Integrated payments. Self-sovereign by default.

## **The Email Parallel**

This architecture should feel familiar—it's how email worked from the beginning:

- **Federated servers** that anyone can run
- **DNS-based routing** to find the right server
- **Store-and-forward** message delivery
- **No central authority** controlling the network

But unlike email, we start with strong cryptography. No trust in certificate authorities. No plaintext metadata. No permanent server-side storage.

## **Reasonable Security for Real Devices**

We're not building a messenger for hypothetical privacy purists with airgapped devices. This is for real people using normal phones with Google Services, Apple Intelligence, social media apps, and closed-source components.

Our threat model is honest: we protect against corporate surveillance and casual deanonymization, but we can't save you from a fully compromised device. **Reasonable privacy in an unreasonable world**.

## **Open Source, Open Network**

The server code is fully open source. Anyone can audit the cryptography, run their own node, or build compatible clients. The network grows stronger with each new server, not weaker.

This isn't about building another messaging company. It's about rebuilding messaging infrastructure the way the internet was meant to work: **federated, cryptographic, and user-controlled**.

## **The Vision**

Imagine a world where:

- Your messaging identity belongs to you, not a corporation
- You can tip your friends instantly without leaving the chat
- You can maintain separate identities for different contexts
- Your server can't read your messages even if it wanted to
- No single entity can shut down the network
- Privacy is the default, not a premium feature

This isn't science fiction. The cryptography exists. The infrastructure is simple. The only missing piece was someone willing to build it.

We're building it now.
